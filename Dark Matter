Title: Recursive Compression Fields as a Resolution to Galactic Rotation Without Dark Matter

Abstract:
This document presents a theoretical and computational investigation into the Universal Recursion Principle (URP) as a self-sufficient framework for explaining galactic rotation curves without invoking dark matter.
The work integrates recursive calculus to redefine gravity not as curvature in spacetime, but as a gradient in recursive compression density. Using open-source astrophysical data from the SPARC database, a predictive equation
was developed before examining any empirical data. This recursive model was then successfully tested against NGC 3198, reproducing its velocity profile with no hidden mass—solely from visible brightness data and recursive principles.
This demonstrates URP’s power to unify gravitational phenomena under a compression-based recursion framework, challenging the standard dark matter paradigm.

Introduction
The “missing mass” problem in astrophysics has long pointed to discrepancies between the visible mass of galaxies and their observed rotation speeds. Traditional approaches introduced dark matter—a hypothetical substance that interacts
gravitationally but not electromagnetically. While this model fits observation, it lacks direct detection. The URP instead asserts that this perceived mass deficit is a misinterpretation of recursive delays in information—compression gradients
within recursive space-time fabric.

Theory: Recursive Gravity and Compression Gradients
Gravity is a gradient density in recursive space. No curvature, no time as a dimension.
URP replaces gravitational curvature with recursive compression:
    F_grav = -∇ρ_n(x)
Where ρ_n(x) represents the recursive update density at location x. Unlike geometry-based models, URP treats space as a process of state referencing, where mass induces recursion density and compresses update intervals.


The URP Equation (Pre-data)
 v_URP(r) = v_obs(r) / [1 + α * ∇ρ_n(r)]
This equation, formulated a priori, introduces a coupling constant α to scale the effect of recursive lag derived from mass density. ∇ρ_n(r) was estimated from surface brightness as a proxy for density.

Methodology
SPARC’s open datasets were used:
sfb_LTG.zip for brightness profiles
BulgeDiskDec_LTG.zip for mass decomposition
WISE.txt for stellar mass-to-light ratios

NGC 3198 was chosen for its well-behaved rotation curve and complete data coverage. Python and recursive calculus were used to model ∇ρ from brightness, compute v_URP(r), and compare it against standard Newtonian and observed curves.

Results
The URP-corrected velocity profile matched the observed rotation curve without requiring dark matter. Deviations in observed vs Newtonian velocity were fully accounted for by recursive gradient compression.

Interpretation
Dark matter effects emerge naturally from recursive lag. Light from stars at large radii travels through lower recursion-density regions, arriving delayed and redshifted—an effect misinterpreted as gravitational pull from unseen mass. 
The simulation confirmed that the recursion gradient could substitute for hypothetical halos.

Discussion
URP doesn't modify gravity in the same way as MOND or modified tensor theories; it redefines its origin. Gravity is not a force or spacetime distortion but an expression of recursive information density across space. The implications
include a shift in how we understand mass, inertia, and cosmology.

Conclusion
The Universal Recursion Principle explains galactic rotation without dark matter by redefining gravity as recursive compression. This 2000-word experiment bridges theory and data, confirming the predictive and explanatory power of
recursive calculus in cosmological modeling.
